# Statistics With Python
This Notebook includes frequency statical practices in python. This notebook shows different activities of various femas libraries used to work with statistical tasks for Data Science.

**Central Tendency:** In this part, the notebook shows how take random populationa and sample then finds mean, median and mode of that sample. finally compers them.

**Measur of Disparsion, Range, Quartile, Interquartile range, Variance and Stardared Deviation:** In this part the notebook show how to find Measure of Disparsion, Range, Quartile, Interquaritle Range and Variance.

**Descriptive Statistics:** In this part shows the different activities of descriptive statistics in python including Skewness and Kurtosis.

**Inferential Statistics:** Inferential statistics infers properties of a population. Here this notebook shows different activities for inferential statistics in python.

**Point of Estimation:** Here showing confidance interval method among various methods to find point of estimation.

**Data Visualization:** In this part this notebook shows various useful methods of data visualization including pie chart, bar chart, boxplot, strip plot, swarm plot and heat map etc.

**Types of Distribution:** Here showed different types of distribution including Bernoulli distribution, Geometric distribution, Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution and Normal distribution.

**Central Limit Theorem:** In this part this notebook shows the Central Limit Theorem.

**Probability Mass Function and Probability Density Function:** Some of probability studies are showed here.

**Qumulativ Distribution Function:** We know about qumulative distribution, that practices showed here with python.

**Confidence Interval:** To find confidence interval we have to use pandas and seaborn, those practices shows here.
